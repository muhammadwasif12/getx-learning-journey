# GetX Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my GetX Learning Journey repository! This project serves as a documentation and practical implementation of my progress in mastering **GetX** for Flutter, mainly focusing on State Management, Dependency Injection, and Route Management.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **State Management**: Simple (`GetBuilder`) vs Reactive (`Obx`, `GetX`).
- **Route Management**: Named routes, navigation without context (`Get.to()`, `Get.off()`).
- **Dependency Management**: `Get.put()`, `Get.lazyPut()`, `Get.find()`.
- **Utilities**: Internationalization, Themes, Dialogs, Snackbars, BottomSheets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter**
- **GetX** (State Management)
- **Dart**

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadwasif12/getx-learning-journey.git

2. **Install dependencies:**

   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Run the app:**
